#' @details From the U.S. Census Bureau:  "The American Community Survey (ACS) asks respondents about their primary workplace location. When information about workersâ€™ residence location and workplace location are coupled, a commuting flow is generated. The origin-destination flow format informs our understanding of interconnectedness between communities, including the interchange of people, goods, and services." For additional information, see the [page](https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/commuting/guidance/flows.html) on commuter data.
