  - title: Datasets
    desc: 'The website "Making Maps with R" uses the datasets within this package. These datasets have a spatial/location component in that they can be located on a map. These objects are either of `sf` class or can be converted to it. `sf` is a package and abbreviation for "simple features." It is the standard for encoding spatial vector data. While 18 geometry types are supported, only seven are used in practice: polygons, lines, points and their "multi" combinations.'
