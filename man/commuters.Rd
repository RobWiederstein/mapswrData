\details{
From the U.S. Census Bureau:  "The American Community Survey (ACS) asks respondents about their primary workplace location. When information about workers’ residence location and workplace location are coupled, a commuting flow is generated. The origin-destination flow format informs our understanding of interconnectedness between communities, including the interchange of people, goods, and services."
