\details{
Napoleon's invasion and subsequent retreat from Russia is notable for the significant loss of life.  While exact numbers are elusive, historians estimate that Napoleon began the campaign with 450,000 troops and ended with 120,000.  Napoleon's eastward progress ended in Moscow in November of 1812.  Inadequate supplies required the French Army to retreat but only after the onset of winter like conditions.  Frigid temperatures and disease decimated the remaining army.  Charles Joseph Minard, an early pioneer in visualization, captured the French Army's losses in his famous graphic that has been called "the best statistical graphic ever drawn" by Edward Tufte.
